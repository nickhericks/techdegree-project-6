:mag: Live version available at [nickhericks.github.io/techdegree-project-6/](https://nickhericks.github.io/techdegree-project-6/)

## Project objective

In this project, a JSON file is used to store all the data about the earlier techdegree projects that I've built. Pug uses the JSON data and templates to generate the markup that is ultimately displayed in the browser.

Node.js and Express are used to import the required dependencies, link the JSON with the Pug templates, set up routes to handle requests, set up the middleware to utilize static files like CSS, handle errors, and set up a server to serve the project.

## Techniques and concepts

<!-- - AJAX (Fetch request)
- Third-party API
- JSON objects
- Array iteration methods -->

## Additional features

<!-- In addition to completing the basic requirements for this techdegree project, I also added additional features including:

- [x] Added live search filtering for employee cards on the page
- [x] Added 'Prev' and 'Next' buttons for navigating cards within modal
- [x] Personalized CSS styling (colors, fonts, etc.) -->

## Code example

<!-- This lesson was all about AJAX, so it seems fitting to show the fetch request used:

```javascript
// Request data for 12 random users from the Random User Generator API
fetch('https://randomuser.me/api/?results=12&nat=us')
	.then(response => response.json())
	.then(data => displayEmployees(data.results));
``` -->
